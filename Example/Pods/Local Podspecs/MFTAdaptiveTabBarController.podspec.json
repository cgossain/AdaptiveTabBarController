  "description": "The MFTAdaptiveTabBarController offers an adaptive view controller that can be installed as the root view controller of an application.\n\nWhen in a horizontally compact environment, the controller installs a UITabBarController to its interface. When horizontally regular, the controller installs a MFTVerticalTabBarController to its interface. The MFTVerticalTabBarController is a view controller that provides a tab bar on the left side of its interface, and is more appropriate in regular environments.",
